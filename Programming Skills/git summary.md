### 1. What's Git & Github

Git, is a free open-source versioning control programming language, that allows the user to track changes made during production, and also revert changes. All of this to ensure proper development backup and flexibility. GitHub is the most known remote repository service into the web, other platforms include GitLab and BitBucket. It's recommended to every programmer create your own GitHub account, focusing to showcase all of the projects they developed. This powerful language is used within development scene by various programmers to collaborate between.

There are fundamental previous knowledges and terms to be understood before getting started to learn git.

**_Knowledge:_**

+ Basic from computation.
+ Basic from Programming Logic.
+ Terminal and Command Line (CLI).
+ Basic Knowledge on IDEs.

**_Common Terms:_**

+ IDE - Integrated Development Environment
+ Command Line Interface - Also known as Terminal, Shell or Console.
+ Directory - Where your files are within (Folder).
+ Repository - Where your project files are kept.
+ README.md - A file to describe your project into GitHub

### 2. How to use it

**_Installing Git._**

Before starting practicing, it`s important to download Git into your hardware to work with, you can get instructions at (https://git-scm.com/downloads) or (https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), Installation instructions vary depending of your operating system. I recommend installing it through Terminal

**_Creating a repository:_**

You can create a repository directly from GitHub, a repository stores all of your project files and it's an excellent way to keep your projects online and access anywhere. The most common and fundamental file in a GitHub repository is a readme file, which its main objective is to describe what's in the project and explain completely since from concepts to its functions. Alternatively, under a local folder, insert "git init" with the Console to initialize a new repository into your PC, doing it, you're ready to start to code and using git after it.

**_Creating an Excellent README.md:_**

Before getting started to explain better about Git, It's recommended to create a README.md description in GitHub itself, since it's much more versatile to view, it uses a simple text structure, and you can change the text size with # (headers) and put images with drag & drop in his field or manually using relative links. You can also add emojis, this will make your README.md more colorful and creative, despite not being obligatory.

They need to summarize your project with quick and objective information, some of them includes:

+ A brief explanation about your project, what it does and what's its main goal.
+ Instructions on installation of your project & usage guide.
+ List all of its dependencies, could be tools, library and software.
+ Licensing details & how can someone contribute to your open project.

**_How it works then?_**

Using Git, you can track your code logs and revert potential mistakes you did into the project, to "save" these changes, you need to commit them, using the command "git commit -m "message"", also, you need to track what's added and changed with "add" and "rm", to revert those changes, use "restore" to recover lost files. You can what changes are staged with "git status", to make these changes appear in an online repository, you need to use git push and will be asked a permission to your account to connect your IDE. You now just learned about some of basic snapshot skills of Git!

**_Branching explained:_**

When thinking about Git, you could already think what happens if you broke the entire project, unhappily, it's possible to "destroy" a project, you need some caution to implement features and fix bugs if available, but when talking about that. Git brings Branching as solution, before applying changes in a definitive way, you can test and code creating a branch, this allows the programmer to create a copy of the existing repository in a new development environment, it's really useful since don't affect the repository main's branch. It preserves main code from any mistake. 

To create, delete and manage with your branches, use "git branch" to help with it, to switch, use "switch" command When done with proper update to your project, you can merge using "merge" command to Git system automatically combine changes with a smooth transition. This avoids changing when your main repository is deployed for in a real working application.

## 3. Essential commands

Below, there a shortlist of the most used commands within git, some of these needs additional parameters to execute a function. Used commonly to specify the command to a more customizable experience.

+ git clone - Get all clean files from an existing remote repository to a local directory from your PC.
+ git init - Start a brand new Git repository!
+ git add - Tracks changed files in Git system.
+ git rm - Remove your files permanently, so use it with caution!
+ git mv - Move or rename a file.
+ git diff - Check differences between commits.
+ git commit - Save your file changes in Git system.
+ git push - Upload your Git commit to a remote repository like GitHub.
+ git pull - Update your local project with an actual version located in a remote repository.
+ git checkout - Restore working tree files or changes branches.
+ git branch - List, create, or delete branches.
+ git merge - Merge your development branch to main branch.
+ git switch - Switch between branches.
+ git status - it shows your commit change status.
+ git log - Shows commit logs using a list.

## 4. Complete dictionary

As most of programming languages, you can access its documentation to deepen your comprehension, with git, isn't different, below, you can access git's official documentation to check and learn further about this version control language. Despite suggesting it, the most effective way to learn Git is practicing with effort.
