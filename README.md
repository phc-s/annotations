### About
This repository's main objective is to store simple summary of subjects I find studying recently, they aren't necessarily acts as a complete guide or tutorial to learn, but still being a nice indie mind map for everyone who knows about those technologies.
### Instructions
I recommend to open these files with Windows Notepad, Xed Text Editor from Linux any other App that properly shows .txt files in your Operating System. You need just to freely read!
