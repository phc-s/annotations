### About
This repository's main objective is to store simple summary of subjects I find studying recently, they aren't necessarily acts as a complete guide or tutorial to learn, but still being a nice indie mind map for everyone who knows about those technologies.
### Instructions
I recommend to open these files with Windows Notepad or any other App that properly shows .txt files.
