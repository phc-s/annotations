### 2. How to use it

**_Accessing Figma._**

Since Figma is a online application, it's required to create a new account in order to use it, necessary to store your projects, allow online interactions within Figma. If you have a account, you can directly learn about the most essential surface elements of Figma. Upon access. You will commonly be directed through files section, where will listed of your drafts. in the main screen you do a series of actions described below

Recents - Here, you will check the most recent activity in Figma, both for your project or from some other external activities within Figma.
Drafts - Drafts are the name given to the design files you create, it uses this general name since it can also include Figjam and Slide decks.
Trash - You can release unused content in the trash, unlike most of online trash section out there, there's no deletion deadline.

**_Design Files._**

Design files are the center within the Figma, I will focus only on it and ignore for now FigJam and slide decks, since those tool I do not use to produce with. Still not scrapping the idea of summarizing them. When acessing a Design File, it automatically creates as "untitled", it's highly suggested to rename it! Before diving into the main section, let's learn about the essential visual elements that covers a Figma Draft, they're located at your toolbox below.

Navigation - to select the items you wish in your project view, as default is selected the "move" tool, if youn want to not move the items but the project view, use the hand tool, when managing to scale and rotate your object, consider using the Hand Tool 

+ Frame - Used to simulate some device or section, is really good to use it instead rectangles to project your 
Shapes -  You can create various shapes with it, including circles, rectangles, stars, lines

Pen - 

Comment -

There are 4 places that will be used frequently when creating with Figma below, you will follow each of them and 

File is one of the sections of the Figma Draft, here you can organize, check and select all of the items, visual elements, text etc., they're found in "layers" section, while if you want to divide into various workspaces, you can add Pages, allowing changing its name. the elements contained in file sections can have its properties changed into the inspector

The best way to become a good developer in Figma is by having practice and interest in learning with Figma, spending time creating and discovering tools can lead to a rich portfolio and improve your agility, precision and prototyping / design skills, I`m still learning Figma, and during the updates, New features and tools will get available, there's no exact "documentation" like programming languages, since Figma works differently regarding versioning, still, you can learn, check and review information with its own Figma Learn - Help Center, there's no better way than seeing official guides, but I highly suggest seeing courses for professionals too, I finish this summary saying a special thanks to Lucas Marte for making the Figma PRO series of courses on Udemy (Available only in Portuguese Brazilian).
