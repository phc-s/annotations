The best way to become a good developer in Figma is by having practice and interest in learning with Figma, spending time creating and discovering tools can lead to a rich portfolio and improve your agility, precision and prototyping / design skills, I`m still learning Figma, and during the updates, New features and tools will get available, there's no exact "documentation" like programming languages, since Figma works differently regarding versioning, still, you can learn, check and review information with its own Figma Learn - Help Center, there's no better way than seeing official guides, but I highly suggest seeing courses for professionals too, I finish this summary saying a special thanks to Lucas Marte for making the Figma PRO series of courses on Udemy (Available only in Portuguese Brazilian).
